# LVQ-Clustering-Algorithm-For-WaterMelon-4.0
This file is a very simple code for clustering with the algorithm named LVQ(Learning Vector Quantization). We use the dataset in Machine Learning written by Zhihua.Zhou. Thanks for the detail pseudocode in the book. In this time, I use python to implement LVQ. I hope this code could give you some inspiration.

You can download the file free.
I recommand you to run this program in Mac OS or Linux. Just a preference. You can use Windows definitely, however, remember, python is necessary.

I'll tell you how to use this program as follows(Especially for mac OS and Linux):
1. Open Your Terminal (No need to log in your ssh, cause this pro is so easy that the CPU in your Computer is enough)
2. Find the Folder where you download this file
3. Input python LVQ_Clustering.py and enter
4. The pro will show you 5 graphs, which tells you the iteration of the algorithm
5. Note, cause of the Random part in this pro, you'll find every time you run this pro, the result is different, it's normal.

Last but not Least : If you have any problems, you can write a comment, and I'll response to you if I see the question.
Thanks for Download This file. Wish you have a fantastic time in LVQ Algorithm.
