# LVQ-Clustering-Algorithm-For-WaterMelon-4.0
This file is a very simple code for clustering with the algorithm named LVQ(Learning Vector Quantization). We use the dataset in Machine Learning written by Zhihua.Zhou. Thanks for the detail pseudocode in the book. In this time, I use python to implement LVQ. I hope this code could give you some inspiration.
